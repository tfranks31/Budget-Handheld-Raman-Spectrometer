# Budget-Handheld-Raman-Spectrometer
An inexpensive DIY handheld Raman spectrometer! Ever want to make a handheld Raman spectrometer for under $300?
Probably not! However, matter is just about everywhere and makes up most of everything. It would be cool to have a 
device that tells you what something is made out of, and would be even cooler to build it yourself!

This repository serves as the main repository for this project, and contains source code, electrical schematics, CAD 
models, future plans, and documentation for it all.
